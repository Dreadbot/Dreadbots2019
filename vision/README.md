# Python Vision Code
There are two types of files in this directory, GRIP and normal python

# What to do with grip files
Nothing. Leave them completely and totally alone. I made some changes to them so that it doesn't immediately crash when there is no contour.
These are auto generated files, and are not meant to be readable. All values are set so that they see our specific contours.

# What to do with normal python files
Look at them. I've tried my best to comment as much as I can. As of 2/6/19 testpipeline.py is the working python file. That will change soon as I will stop testing and switch over to the real deal. The normal file will likely be much less commented, so go ahead and read testpipeline to understand what it is i'm doing.

# Dependencies
You will need python 3.6 or higher.
OpenCV of version 4.0.0 or higher.
Numpy of version 1.15.4 or higher.
